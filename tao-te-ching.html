          <h4>J. Legge, 1891</h4>
          <div class='text'>
            <p>The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and<br />
            unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and<br />
            unchanging name.</p>
            <p>(Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven<br />
            and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all<br />
            things.</p>
            <p>Always without desire we must be found,<br />
            If its deep mystery we would sound;<br />
            But if desire always within us be,<br />
            Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.</p>
            <p>Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development<br />
            takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them<br />
            the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that<br />
            is subtle and wonderful.</p>

          <div class='text'>
            <p>The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao<br />
            The name that can be named is not the eternal name<br />
            The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth<br />
            The named is the mother of myriad things<br />
            Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence<br />
            Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations<br />
            These two emerge together but differ in name<br />
            The unity is said to be the mystery<br />
            Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders</p>

            <p>The tao that can be told<br />
            is not the eternal Tao<br />
            The name that can be named<br />
            is not the eternal Name.</p>
            <p>The unnamable is the eternally real.<br />
            Naming is the origin<br />
            of all particular things.</p>
            <p>Free from desire, you realize the mystery.<br />
            Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.</p>
            <p>Yet mystery and manifestations<br />
            arise from the same source.<br />
            This source is called darkness.</p>
            <p>Darkness within darkness.<br />
            The gateway to all understanding.</p>

          <div class='text'>
            <p>All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing<br />
            this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill<br />
            of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the<br />
            want of skill is.</p>
            <p>So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to<br />
            (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the<br />
            idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the<br />
            figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from<br />
            the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and<br />
            tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and<br />
            that being before and behind give the idea of one following another.</p>
            <p>Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and<br />
            conveys his instructions without the use of speech.</p>
            <p>All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show<br />
            itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership;<br />
            they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a<br />
            reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no<br />
            resting in it (as an achievement).</p>
            <p>The work is done, but how no one can see;<br />
            &#8217;Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.</p>

            <p>When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises<br />

            Long and short reveal each other<br />

            Music and voice harmonize each other<br />

            Therefore the sages:<br />
            Manage the work of detached actions<br />
            Conduct the teaching of no words<br />
            They work with myriad things but do not control<br />

            They act but do not presume<br />

            <p>When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one<br />
            embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided<br />
            attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of<br />
            pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away<br />
            the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without<br />
            a flaw.</p>
            <p>In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed<br />
            without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his<br />
            gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his<br />
            intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be<br />
            without knowledge?</p>
            <p>(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces<br />
            them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not<br />
            boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them.<br />
            This is what is called &#8216;The mysterious Quality&#8217; (of the Tao).</p>

            being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting<br />

            meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be<br />

            <p>And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be<br />
            (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to<br />

            <p>The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree,<br />
            and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things<br />
            alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them<br />
            return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable<br />
            world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them<br />
            return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the<br />
            state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that<br />
            they have fulfilled their appointed end.</p>
            <p>The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To<br />
            know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads<br />
            to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging<br />
            rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity<br />
            and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things).<br />
            From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he<br />
            who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to<br />
            heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long;<br />
            and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.</p>

            <p>The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty,<br />
            full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he<br />
            whose (desires) are many goes astray.</p>
            <p>Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of<br />
            humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self-<br />
            display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore<br />
            he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is<br />
            acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires<br />
            superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that<br />
            therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him.</p>
            <p>That saying of the ancients that &#8216;the partial becomes complete&#8217; was<br />
            not vainly spoken:&#8212;all real completion is comprehended under it.</p>

            <p>Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity<br />
            of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a<br />
            sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these<br />
            (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth<br />
            cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man!</p>
            <p>Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are<br />
            also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the<br />
            manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while<br />
            even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where<br />
            they fail.</p>
            <p>Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness<br />
            of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation<br />
            have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees<br />
            in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao).<br />
            (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of<br />
            faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others).</p>

            <p>There was something undefined and complete, coming into<br />
            existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless,<br />
            standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in<br />
            no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of<br />

            <p>I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao<br />

            call it The Great.</p>
            <p>Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes<br />

            great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also<br />
            great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage)<br />

            &#8216;Men of small virtue,&#8217; and as &#8216;Carriages without a nave.&#8217; Is not this<br />
            an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see<br />
            the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of<br />
            the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it<br />
            answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves<br />
            elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an<br />
            (ordinary) stone.</p>

            <p>Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao,<br />
            earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when<br />
            they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it.<br />
            Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh<br />
            greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit<br />
            to be the Tao.</p>
            <p>Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8216;The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack;<br />
            Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;<br />
            Its even way is like a rugged track.<br />
            Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;<br />
            Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes;<br />
            And he has most whose lot the least supplies.<br />
            Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;<br />
            Its solid truth seems change to undergo;<br />
            Its largest square doth yet no corner show<br />
            A vessel great, it is the slowest made;<br />
            Loud is its sound, but never word it said;<br />
            A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.&#8217;</p>
            <p>The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is<br />
            skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them<br />
            complete.</p>

            <p>If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position<br />
            to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should<br />
            be most afraid of would be a boastful display.</p>
            <p>The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the<br />
            by-ways.</p>
            <p>Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their<br />
            fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They<br />
            shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their<br />
            girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a<br />
            superabundance of property and wealth;&#8212;such (princes) may be called<br />
            robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely!</p>

            <p>For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering<br />
            the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like<br />

            <p>It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early<br />
            return (to man&#8217;s normal state). That early return is what I call the<br />
            repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that<br />
            repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation<br />
            (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not<br />
            what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall<br />
            be, he may be the ruler of a state.</p>

            They learn to unlearn<br />

            <p>That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage<br />

            <p>In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his<br />

            <p>There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water,<br />
            and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing<br />
            that can take precedence of it;&#8212;for there is nothing (so effectual)<br />
            for which it can be changed.</p>
            <p>Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and<br />
            the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.</p>
            <p>Therefore a sage has said,<br />
            &#8216;He who accepts his state&#8217;s reproach,<br />
            Is hailed therefore its altars&#8217; lord;<br />
            To him who bears men&#8217;s direful woes<br />
            They all the name of King accord.&#8217;</p>
            <p>Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.</p>

            <p>Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water<br />
            Yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong<br />
            This is because nothing can replace it</p>
            <p>That the weak overcomes the strong<br />
            And the soft overcomes the hard<br />
            Everybody in the world knows<br />
            But cannot put into practice</p>
            <p>Therefore sages say:<br />
            The one who accepts the humiliation of the state<br />
            Is called its master<br />
            The one who accepts the misfortune of the state<br />

            <p>Nothing in the world<br />

            nothing can surpass it.</p>
            <p>The soft overcomes the hard;<br />

            Evil cannot enter his heart.<br />

            <p>When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a<br />
            great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind<br />
            of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the<br />
            other)?</p>
            <p>Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand<br />
            portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the<br />
            (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the<br />
            attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the<br />
            engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the<br />
            conditions favourable to himself.</p>
            <p>In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always<br />
            on the side of the good man.</p>

            <p>After settling a great dispute<br />
            There must be remaining resentments<br />
            How can this be considered good?<br />
            Therefore the sage holds the left part of the contract<br />
            But does not demand payment from the other person<br />
            Those who have virtue hold the contract<br />
            Those without virtue hold the collections</p>
