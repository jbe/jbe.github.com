This Git repository contains the source code that can be used to generate the HTML and related files that make up my homepage. I have been depending on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, because it comes included with GitHub pages.

The site itself can be seen at [http://jostein.be](http://jostein.be).

All code is &copy; 2014 Jostein Berre Eliassen. The included webfonts Al Fresco Bold and Origo are licensed commercial fonts, and must therefore not be downloaded or used.  These fonts can be bought from myfonts.com if you want to use them on your own site.
