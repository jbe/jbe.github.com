This is the Git repository that contains the source code that can be used to generate the HTML and related files that make up my public home page. I have been depending on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator to automate this compilation, partly because it is included with GitHub pages free of charge.

The site itself exists at [http://jostein.be](http://jostein.be).
