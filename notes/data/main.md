It is minimal but effective, and made to fit editors like Vim or Emacs. The basic idea is to have all the content in one large file, and keep adding entries at the top. This is the basic format:

    >>> 2015 11 28
    >>> Entry title [article] [programming] {draft}
    Some content using *markdown*

Finding entries is as easy as searching for `[tag_name]`, `{mark_name}` or `>>> YYYY MM DD`. The file can be split up if you absolutely need to, but the idea is to have everything together, and use your editor to navigate.

The engine does not have its own project yet, but you you will find it on [my github](//github.com/jbe) eventually.
