It is also a notepad of random thoughts. The visual style is based on a useful (for geeks) site called [weblog.sh](http://weblog.sh), with a few additions.

>>> More about the new blog engine.. [programming] [output]

I made a new "blog" "engine" for this notepad. Strangely, i woke up with the desire to create a blogging tool where i could keep all the content in one large file, and keep adding entries at the top. This is the basic file format:

    >>> 2015 11 28
    >>> Entry title [article] [programming] {draft}
    Some content using *markdown*.

    >>> Another entry on the same day [random]
    And so on...

Finding entries is as easy as searching for `[tag_name]`, `{mark_name}` or `>>> YYYY MM DD`. The file can be split up if you absolutely need to, but the idea is to have everything together, and use your editor to navigate.

The engine is work in progress, and does not have its own project yet, but you you will find it in [the source code](//github.com/jbe/jbe.github.com) if you're interested.

>>> I want a programming language that..  [programming] [idea]

- can be dynamically redefined at runtime, including the syntax
- integrates interpreter, compiler and compiled program
- is strongly typed without anyone noticing it
- defines its functional aspects imperatively
- ..and its imperative aspects functionally
- distinguishes naturally between defininition and execution
- lets you express what you are thinking
- provides universal names for anonymous constructs
