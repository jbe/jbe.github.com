>>> Minion, Crimson Text and Droid Sans [fonts] [design]

I've been looking into typesetting and fonts recently. I looked at different books to see which fonts they use, and I absolutely prefer *Minion*. Minion is a commercial font inspired by classical roman serifs, and it is a joy to read.

Thankfully, there is a free alternative that looks very similar. It is called *Crimson Text*, and is available on Google Fonts.

Serifs tend to look good when paired with a bold sans-serif, and i happen to like *Source Sans*, which is also free. So there you go, this page is now using those two fonts.

It is also a notepad of randomness. The visual style was originally inspired by a geeky site called [weblog.sh](http://weblog.sh).

>>> I made a hacky blog file format [programming] [output]

I made a new *"blog" "engine"* for this notepad. I woke up with the desire to create a blogging tool where you keep all the content in one large file, and keep adding entries at the top. This is the basic file format:

    >>> 2015 11 28
    >>> Entry title [article] [programming] {draft}
    Some content using *markdown*.

    >>> Another entry on the same day [random]
    And so on...

Finding entries is as easy as searching for `[tag_name]`, `{mark_name}` or `>>> YYYY MM DD`. The file can be split up if you absolutely need to, but the idea is to have everything together, and use your editor to navigate.

The engine is work in progres. .You you will find it in [the source code](//github.com/jbe/jbe.github.com) for this page if you're interested.

- defines its functional aspects imperatively
- ..and its imperative aspects functionally
- distinguishes naturally between defininition and execution
